and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.1] - 2025-09-19

### Fixed
- **HTTP status code mapping**: Corrected incorrect 422 status code handling in HttpClient
  - Fixed `422 Unprocessable Entity` responses that were being incorrectly mapped to `ApiException`
  - Now properly maps `422` to `ValidationException` as intended for validation errors
- **OptOut examples**: Fixed critical issues in all opt-out management examples
  - Fixed undefined `$optOutId` variable in `get_optout.php`
  - Removed exposed API key security issue in `update_optout.php`
  - Fixed `delete_optout.php` to use opt-out ID instead of incorrect phone number parameter
  - Updated all opt-out examples to follow consistent ID-based API patterns
- **ValidationException**: Enhanced error handling to properly extract field-specific validation errors
  - Fixed parameter separation between general errors and validation-specific field errors
  - Improved error message extraction from API responses

### Improved
- **Error handling**: Better validation error processing with proper field-level error extraction
- **Example consistency**: All opt-out examples now follow the same ID-based pattern for better developer experience
- **Security**: Removed hardcoded API keys from example files

## [2.0.0] - 2025-09-19

### Added
- **Minimal architecture**: Completely standalone SMS library with zero external dependencies
- **Native cURL implementation**: Built-in HTTP client using only native PHP cURL extension
- **String-based HTTP bodies**: Simplified request/response handling without stream abstractions
- **Fluent API chaining**: Clean, readable method chaining (`SmsClient::create()->messages()->create()`)
- **Factory methods**: 
  - `SmsClient::create()` - Create SMS client with bearer token and optional configuration
- **Cross-version PHP support**: Enhanced compatibility configuration for PHP 7.4-8.4
- **Proper validation error handling**: Separated general errors from field-specific validation errors

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Removed all external dependencies (Guzzle, PSR interfaces, stream abstractions)
- **BREAKING**: Removed wrapper classes (`Sms` class) - use `SmsClient::create()` directly
- **BREAKING**: HTTP status code mapping corrected:
  - `400 Bad Request` → `ApiException` (was incorrectly mapped to ValidationException)
  - `422 Unprocessable Entity` → `ValidationException` (proper validation error status)
- **Architecture**: Completely rewritten for minimal footprint and maximum simplicity
- **Dependencies**: Now requires only `php ^7.4||^8.0`, `ext-json`, and `ext-curl`
- **API style**: All examples updated to use fluent method chaining for better readability
- **Test compatibility**: Updated test files to use PHPDoc annotations instead of typed properties for broader PHP 7.4+ compatibility

### Improved
- **Zero dependencies**: No more version conflicts or complex dependency trees
- **Instant installation**: Works immediately with any PHP 7.4+ environment
- **Smaller footprint**: Significantly reduced library size and complexity
- **Better readability**: Fluent chaining makes code more concise and easier to understand
- **Universal compatibility**: Works with any PHP setup without external requirements
- **Validation error handling**: `ValidationException` now properly extracts and exposes field-specific validation errors via `getValidationErrors()` method
- **PHPStan compatibility**: Added `treatPhpDocTypesAsCertain: false` for cross-version type checking
- **OptOut examples**: Fixed all undefined variables and incorrect API usage patterns

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: All PSR interfaces and stream abstractions (unnecessary complexity)
- **BREAKING**: HTTP client discovery system (replaced with simple native cURL)
- **BREAKING**: External HTTP client support (Guzzle, Symfony, HTTPlug)
- **BREAKING**: Stream factories and PSR-17 implementations
- **BREAKING**: `Sms` wrapper class (use `SmsClient::create()` instead)

### Fixed
- **Dependency conflicts**: Eliminated by removing all external dependencies
- **Installation complexity**: Now works out-of-the-box with zero configuration
- **Memory overhead**: Reduced by removing abstraction layers
- **Import statements**: Fixed missing use statements for HTTP interfaces in HttpClient class
- **HTTP status codes**: Corrected 400/422 status code mapping to follow REST API standards
- **Validation errors**: Fixed ValidationException to properly separate error details from validation-specific field errors
- **PHP compatibility**: Fixed cURL initialization check for compatibility across PHP 7.4-8.4
- **OptOut examples**: 
  - Fixed undefined `$optOutId` variable in `get_optout.php`
  - Removed exposed API key from `update_optout.php`
  - Fixed `delete_optout.php` to use opt-out ID instead of phone number
  - Updated all examples to follow consistent ID-based API patterns
- **Cross-version compatibility**: Enhanced PHPStan configuration and cURL handling for PHP 7.4-8.4

### Technical Details
- Implemented native cURL-based HTTP client with authentication and error handling
- Simplified request/response handling using string bodies instead of streams
